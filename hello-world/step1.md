This is your first step.

##Â Task

First things first.

Lets check out our version of nodejs. Dragonchain just needs atleast version 10 or greater.

`node --version`{{execute}}

Well, that's ancient! Lets update to the latest LTS version of nodeJS (v12) to be sure we are supported.

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash && apt-get install nodejs'`{{execute}}

That does it for the environment.

Next we will install the commandline tool which will help us build our smart contracts on the blockchain.
